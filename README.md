# Pizza-Database-Analysis
This SQL project focuses on a database schema tailored for a pizza store, encompassing four key tables: order_details, pizzas, orders, and pizza_types, crucial for managing various aspects of the business 1 . Each table holds specific data elements essential for operations, such as order details, pizza types, and customer orders 1 .

The order_details table includes identifiers for entries, order linking, pizza identification, and quantity ordered 1 . In contrast, the pizzas table tracks unique pizza identifiers, pizza types, sizes, and prices 1 . The orders table captures order IDs, dates, and times of placements 1 . Lastly, the pizza_types table contains identifiers, names, categories, and ingredients for each pizza type 1 .

For a Pizza Sales Store Manager, this SQL project offers valuable insights for informed decision-making and efficient operational management 1 . Managers can perform Sales Analysis, Inventory Management, analysis of Customer Preferences, assess Operational Efficiency, and gain Marketing Insights from the data available 1 .

Overall, this project serves not only as a data management system but also as a strategic business intelligence tool for store managers to enhance customer experience and profitability 1 . When shared on a blog, this project can showcase the practical use of structured SQL queries for real-world business applications, benefiting data analysts and business owners alike
